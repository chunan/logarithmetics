Simple log domain operations for positive numbers
to extend range of computation in exchange of accuracy.

LLDouble has two states:
  lin domain:
    operations just like normal doubles, range = (2.45e-308 ~ inf)
  log domain:
    the numbers are stored in log with natural base
    e.g., 1.0 is stored as 0.0
    operations are performed as if being converted back to linear.
    e.g., A + B = log(exp(A) + exp(B))
Convert between states:
  LLDouble::to_lin()
  LLDouble::to_log()
